## Description
This is my final degree project, a video game where showcases a game where the main mechanic is that your character is in a 3D world and you see in 2D, where upon rotating, you'll be able to observe the deformation of the world.

There are 3 small levels that serve to demonstrate the functionality and potential scalability of this mechanic. There may be some bugs, but the version is already playable. Enjoy it!!!
